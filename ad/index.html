            <p class="lead">I am sure you just want to check my work, so I'll be quick. I am not the smartest, but I am smart. In primary school I was the second smartest kid based on an iq test. When I turned 21 I jumped of a plane for the very 1st time and it was an international flight to a country I did not know much of and had the most basic knoledge of their language. Yes I came here from Peru and since then nothing had stopped me.   </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">I build websites. I specialize in front-end development (HTML, CSS, Javascript) but many times I get my hands dirty with some backend (Ruby on Rails). And I love some bootStrap. If you want to work with me or just say "hey Nella, what's up?" for no reason what so ever, send me an email.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Why I want to code.</span>
                 <p class="lead">My #1 will always be my heartbeat, aka my daugther. I want her to be proud of me and to look up to me. When I was a kid, I was a painter, a writer and an actress for as long as I remember. My parents told me I couldnt follow my dreams because I would not be able to provide. But I said to myself <span style="color: black;"> really? </span> and then after having a job I was so tired of for over 9 years, a light bulb turned on and I started to code at home.
